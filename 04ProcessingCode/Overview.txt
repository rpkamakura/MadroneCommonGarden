General Analyses

* 01IterateThroughAllModels -> try every combination of environmental variables to 
see which ones have the lowest AIC values

* 02PullOutRegressions -> for the ones with the lowest AIC values, pull out the 
parameter estimates (includes Q-Q plots)

* 03PhenologyAnalyses -> both of the above but for the phenology data (includes Q-Q plots)

* 04CrossValidationOutliers -> perform the K-fold cross validation

* 07Percentiles -> shows you what percentile the families are for those that have significant
differences in their mean growth, dieback, mortality, or phenology (at p-value of 0.05)
- note: for simulated data you should see mostly 0s in the output because they are all
randomly generated and should not significantly differ 

08VariabilityGraphs -> look at variation between non-drought (2012 and 2013) and drought
(2014 and 2015) years 

Useful Visualizations

* 04AbioticVis - look at various abiotic variables to look at their distributions
* 05BasicVis - create some useful figures to better understand your results
