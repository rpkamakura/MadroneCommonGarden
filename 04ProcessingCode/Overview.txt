General Analyses

* IterateThroughAllModels -> try every combination of environmental variables to 
see which ones have the lowest AIC values
* PullOutRegressions -> for the ones with the lowest AIC values, pull out the 
parameter estimates 
* PhenologyAnalyses -> both of the above but for the phenology data
* CrossValidationOutliers -> perform the K-fold cross validation and look for
consistent outliers in terms of performance across sites



Useful Visualizations

* Abiotic Vis - look at various abiotic variables to look at their distributions
* Basic Vis - create some useful figures to better understand your results
