The data are not the same as those presented in the paper, but the code are. The
example data are to illustrate the function of the code.

The scripts and data are organized as follows: 

01ExampleRawData - Starting, not clean, example data with errors that our cleaning code aims to catch
02CleaningCode - Code to combine data and do some cleaning
03ExampleCleanedData - Example cleaned data (when you take the data in 01 and process it with 02)
04ProcessingCode - Code to do the running analyses presented in the paper and some extra that help with visualization
05ProcessedDataOutputs - Final outputs from the analyses (of example data)
Liscense - I am happy if you use parts of the code (or improve upon it), just cite
it if you use large portions of it.
